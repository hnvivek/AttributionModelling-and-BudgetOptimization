# Attribution Modeling and Budget Optimization

This project focuses on the various attribution modeling techniques used to assign value to different marketing touchpoints along a customer journey and how to optimize marketing budgets effectively. Attribution modeling helps marketers determine which channels, campaigns, and touchpoints have the most significant impact on conversion rates, leading to more informed budget allocation decisions.

## Attribution Modeling Summary

Attribution models are essential for understanding customer behavior and how different marketing channels contribute to conversions. Below are the key attribution models typically used:

### 1. **First-Touch Attribution**
   - **Description**: Assigns 100% of the conversion value to the first touchpoint in the customer journey.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for businesses focused on brand awareness, as it values the initial customer engagement.
   
### 2. **Last-Touch Attribution**
   - **Description**: Assigns 100% of the conversion value to the last touchpoint before the conversion.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for businesses that value the final action before a purchase, like a call-to-action or checkout process.

### 3. Last Non-Direct Touch Attribution
   - **Description**: Assigns 100% of the conversion credit to the last touchpoint before a direct visit. A direct visit (i.e., when a user types the URL directly) typically indicates that the customer was already influenced by a previous touchpoint.
   - **Use Case**: Useful when you want to ignore direct visits and attribute the conversion to the last meaningful interaction, such as from paid search, organic, or social media.

### 4. **Linear Attribution**
   - **Description**: Distributes the conversion value equally across all touchpoints in the customer journey.
   - **Use Case**: Useful when you want to give equal credit to every interaction in the funnel.

### 5. **Time-Decay Attribution**
   - **Description**: Attributes more credit to touchpoints that occurred closer to the conversion event, with earlier touchpoints receiving less credit.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for businesses that value recency, acknowledging that recent interactions have more influence on conversion.

### 6. **Position-Based (U-Shaped) Attribution**
   - **Description**: Assigns 40% of the credit to the first and last interactions and the remaining 20% is distributed evenly among the middle interactions.
   - **Use Case**: Best for businesses that consider both first and last touchpoints as crucial, but still recognize the influence of middle touchpoints.

### 7. **Markov Chain Attribution**
   - **Description**: A probabilistic model that uses the concept of state transitions to assign value to touchpoints. It takes into account the removal effect, i.e., how the absence of a touchpoint affects the likelihood of conversion.
   - **Use Case**: Perfect for companies wanting to understand the marginal contribution of each touchpoint and the effect of removing any particular touchpoint.

### 8. **Shapley Value Attribution**
   - **Description**: Derived from cooperative game theory, it assigns credit to each touchpoint based on its marginal contribution when it is included versus excluded from the customer journey.
   - **Use Case**: Useful for businesses that want to ensure fairness in how credit is distributed across multiple touchpoints.
